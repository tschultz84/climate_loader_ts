#HARDCODED PARAMETERS
    #BASEYEAR is the year before which station data must be availbale. 
    #stations with no data prior to this year are not loaded. 
    BASEYEAR : 1970
    
    #FIRST_BASE_YEAR is the first year for which data must be available. 
    #stations without data going back to this year are not loaded. 
    FIRST_BASE_YEAR : 1920
     
    #LAST_BASE_YEAR is the last year in the baseline for which data must be available. 
    #stations without data going back to this year are not loaded. 
    LAST_BASE_YEAR : 1955
    
    #BASENOYEARS is the number of years included in the baseline period. 
    BASENOYEARS : 30
    
    #RECENT_TREND_YEARS is the number of years included (starting from the final year in the dataset).
    #in the annual temperature average trendline.  The linear trend is calculated only over this period.
    RECENT_TREND_YEARS : 30
        
    #REQUIRED_TREND_YEARS is minimum number of years required to calculate this trend.
    REQUIRED_TREND_YEARS : 25
    
    #MIN_DAYS_PER_MO is the minimum number of dasys of data which must be present
    #for every month of a year for a dataset to be included.
    # If not, then the year is excluded from dataset.
    MIN_DAYS_PER_MO : 20
    
    #ALPHA is the alpha value cmoparing TMID in the reference and baseline period. 
    #Basically if the P Value from the corresponding t-test exceeds this value,
    #then a change is deteced.
    ALPHA : 0.01
    
    
    #This is the lat/lon distance within which weather stations are serached.
    #This is used to streamline how fast the "closest station" function works. 
            #stations are only sorted by distance if they rae within +/- coord_radius
            #of the reference point. 
    SEARCH_RADIUS : 3
